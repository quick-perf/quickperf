/**
 * The <code>DisableLikeWithLeadingWildcard</code> annotation verifies that SQL statements do not contain LIKE with
 * leading wildcard (% or _). If so, the test will fail.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Example:</h4>
 * <pre>
 *      <b>&#064;DisableLikeWithLeadingWildcard</b>
 *      public void execute_select_who_started_with_like_wildcard() {
 *          <code>..</code>
 *      }
 * </pre>
 * <h4>Note:</h4>
 * <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/searching-for-ranges/like-performance-tuning"><u>This
 * article</u></a>
 * explains why LIKE with leading wildcard could be a bad idea in term of performance. A code sent to the database with
 * a like operator with leading wildcard may be fast in a test having a few data but very slow with the data volume of a
 * production environment.
