/**
 * The <code>DisplaySql</code> annotation displays the SQL statements in the console during the
 * execution of the test method body.
 * <p>
 * Compared to {@link DisplaySqlOfTestMethodBody}, this annotation also displays SQL statements
 * before (JUnit 4: &#064;Before, &#064;BeforeClass) and after (JUnit 4: &#064;After, &#064;AfterClass) the execution of the test method
 * body. <br>
 * <p>
 * It is not recommended to commit your test with this annotation. Indeed, the SQL statements would pollute the logs
 * and may slow down the continuous integration build.
 * <h4>Example:</h4>
 * <pre>
 *      <b>&#064;DisplaySql</b>
 *      public void sql_batch_execution() {
 *          <code>..</code>
 *      }
 * </pre>
