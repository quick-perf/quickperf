## Submission guidelines
When you start to work on an issue, please leave a comment "*I start to work on this issue*", so we can assign it to you. Do not hesitate to ask for information about the issue.

Please rebase your PR on master (no merge). We prefer integrating PR by squashing all the commits and rebase it to master, if your PR has diverged and needs to integrate with master, please rebase on master but do not merge as it will prevent rebasing later on.

## Build QuickPerf

### JDK requirements
You need a JDK (OpenJDK, ...) >= 11 or an Oracle JDK >= 1.8.

### Steps to build QuickPerf
1) Clone the repository
 
   Execute ```git clone https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf.git```.

2) Navigate to the *quickperf* repository

3) Build QuickPerf with Maven

    1. Use Maven installed locally
    
       You need Maven 3. 
       
       Execute ```mvn clean install```.
   
   2. Use a Maven wrapper
   
      The QuickPerf repository includes *Maven Wrapper* scripts (./mvnw or mvnw.bat) to build QuickPerf without having to install Maven locally.

      On Mac or Linux run ```./mvnw clean install```.

      On Windows run ```mvnw.cmd clean install```.
        
### Tips
  ðŸ’¡ To disable Spring Boot tests: ```mvn clean install -P -SpringBootTests```
  
  ðŸ’¡ To not build Spring modules: ```mvn clean install -P -default-spring,-SpringBootTests```

## Test several JDK with Docker

To quickly test multiple linux openjdk locally, you can execute the following command line:

```bash
$> docker container run --rm --name mvn-quickperf-cleaninstall -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $(pwd):/usr/src/quickperf -w /usr/src/quickperf maven:3-jdk-11 mvn clean install
$> docker container run --rm --name mvn-quickperf-cleaninstall -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $(pwd):/usr/src/quickperf -w /usr/src/quickperf maven:3-jdk-12 mvn clean install
```

You can look at [the versions available for the Maven image](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) in the dockerhub.

The following command line allows to test a list of openjdk on unix systems :

```bash
$> for i in {11..12};  do echo "******** Testing with maven:3-jdk-$i **********"; docker container run --rm --name mvn-quickperf-cleaninstall -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $(pwd):/usr/src/quickperf -w /usr/src/quickperf maven:3-jdk-$i mvn clean install; if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then break; fi; done
```

It will fail as soon as one mvn clean install fails.

_Notice: Maven images are packaged only with openjdk not oraclejdk._
